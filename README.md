# Texas A&M University System Cybersecurity Control Standards

Texas A&M System Cybersecurity Control Standards provide system members with additional guidance that enhances State-level requirements for implementing security controls. These standards are prescribed by Texas A&M System Regulation 29.01.03, Information Security, paragraph 1.2(c).

A combined view of the NIST SP 800-53 catalog, Texas statewide control standards, and Texas A&M System control standards is also available in one of these variants:

  - [All controls presented in the Texas Security Control Standards Catalog](https://cyber-standards.tamus.edu/control-catalog)
    - _**Ideal for:** someone who knows exactly which control they want to reference_

  - [Only controls from the Texas Security Control Standards Catalog required by Texas DIR or the Texas A&M System](https://cyber-standards.tamus.edu/required-controls)
    - _**Ideal for:** someone who wants to review all of the required controls that must be implemented, whether by DIR or TAMUS_

  - [Only controls from the Texas Security Control Standards Catalog required by the Texas A&M System](https://cyber-standards.tamus.edu/tamus-required-controls)
    - _**Ideal for:** someone who has already gone through the DIR catalog and implemented all of their required controls but needs a reference to those TAMUS-specific required controls_

  - [Only recently updated Texas A&M System required controls](https://cyber-standards.tamus.edu/recent-updated-controls)
    - _**Ideal for:** someone who wants to check for new additions/updates to TAMUS-specific required controls_

Contributions and feedback for future control standards releases are welcome via GitHub. [Please open a new issue with your feedback](https://github.com/tamuscyber/tamus-control-standards/issues).

Machine-readable formats compliant with the Open Security Controls Assessment Language ([OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/)) are available in the [projectâ€™s GitHub repository](https://github.com/tamuscyber/tamus-control-standards) within `content`.
