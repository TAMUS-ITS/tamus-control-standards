# Texas A&M University System Cybersecurity Control Standards

Texas A&M System Cybersecurity Control Standards provide system members with additional guidance that enhances State-level requirements for implementing security controls.

The `tamus-control-standards` project repository is organized as follows:

Machine-readable formats compliant with the Open Security Controls Assessment Language ([OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/)) are available in the [projectâ€™s GitHub repository](https://github.com/tamuscyber/tamus-control-standards) within `content`.
