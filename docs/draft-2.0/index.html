<h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>Texas A&amp;M University System members publish a security control catalog to implement organizational information security controls in a format that aligns with the Texas Security Control Standards Catalog, prescribed by Title 1 Texas Administrative Code §202.76, Security Control Standards Catalog [<a href="https://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&amp;app=9&amp;p_dir=&amp;p_rloc=&amp;p_tloc=&amp;p_ploc=&amp;pg=1&amp;p_tac=&amp;ti=1&amp;pt=10&amp;ch=202&amp;rl=76" title="Title 1 Texas Administrative Code §202.76, Security Control Standards Catalog">1 TAC 202.76</a>].</p>

<p>Texas A&amp;M System Cybersecurity Control Standards provide system members with additional guidance that enhances State-level requirements for implementing security controls.  These standards are prescribed by Texas A&amp;M System Regulation 29.01.03, Information Security [<a href="https://policies.tamus.edu/29-01-03.pdf" title="Texas A&amp;M System Regulation 29.01.03, Information Security, February 2018">TAMUS 29.01.03</a>], paragraph 1.2(c).</p>

<p>This document is intended to be used as a supplement to Texas Security Control Standards Catalog Version 1.3, updated February 26, 2016 [<a href="http://publishingext.dir.texas.gov/portal/internal/resources/DocumentLibrary/Security%20Control%20Standards%20Catalog.pdf" title="Texas Security Control Standards Catalog, Version 1.3, February 2016">TxDIR Catalog</a>].</p>

<h1 id="lifecycle">Lifecycle</h1>

<p>The Texas A&amp;M University System Office of Cybersecurity will review control standards each even-numbered year, following the Texas Department of Information Resources’ publishing of new statewide security control standards.</p>

<p>Prior to publishing new or revised standards, the Office of Cybersecurity will solicit comments on new control standards from Chief Information Officers and (Chief) Information Security Officers at system members.</p>

<h1 id="data-categorization">Data Categorization</h1>

<p>Texas A&amp;M University System (A&amp;M System) data categorization consists of a minimum of three specific categories based on access restrictions and risk. These categories apply to all members and may be expanded upon as required by the member. While the categorization applicable to specific information may change based on circumstances, the intent of this document is to define the appropriate categories for different types of information. These three categories are:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Category</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Examples</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Comments</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Confidential Information</strong></td>
      <td>Information that must be protected from unauthorized disclosure or public release based on state or federal law or other legal agreement (1 TAC §202.1).</td>
      <td>- Patient billing information and protected health information as protected by HIPAA.<br />- Student education records protected by FERPA.<br />- Information or Information System security plans, reports and related information<br />- Credit/debit card numbers, bank account numbers<br />- Personal financial information<br />- Social security numbers<br />- A&amp;M System intellectual property and research information having commercial potential<br /><br />Confidential Information requiring breach notifications or having stricter access requirements may include SPI as defined by Texas Business and Commerce Code § 521.002(a)(2); credit card numbers covered by PCI DSS v3.1.<br /><br />Classified National Security Information under Executive Order 13526, and Controlled Unclassified Information under Executive Order 13556, shall be protected as prescribed by System Regulations 15.05.01 and 15.05.02, respectively, and the System Facility Security Officer (FSO).</td>
      <td>This category may not be absolute; context is an essential element.<br /><br />Owners of confidential information must ensure such information is correctly categorized.<br /><br />Custodians of confidential information must implement appropriate controls.<br /><br />HIPAA, FTI or PCI information is covered in this category. This category may include agreements or contracts for research work that require higher levels of security and/or procedural elements for handling of information.<br /><br />Consult the Office of General Counsel regarding confidential information requested through open records, subpoena, or other legal process.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Internal Use</strong></td>
      <td>Information that is not generally created for or made available for public consumption but that may or may not be subject to public disclosure through the Texas Public Information Act or similar laws.</td>
      <td>This information includes institutional budgetary, financial and operational records such as expenditures, statistics, contracting information, non-confidential personnel information. It may also include non-confidential internal communications.</td>
      <td>Consult the Office of General Counsel regarding controlled information requested through open records, subpoena, or other legal process.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Public Information</strong></td>
      <td>Public information includes all information made available to the public through posting to public websites, distribution through email, or social media, print publications or other media. This classification also includes information for which public disclosure is intended or required.</td>
      <td>Published system and system member policy documents, organizational charts, Statistical reports, Fast Facts, unrestricted directory information, employee salaries, and educational content available to the public at no cost.</td>
      <td>Information can migrate from one categorization to another based on information lifecycle. For example, a draft policy document would fit the criteria of “Internal Use” until being published upon which it would become “Public Information”.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Each member will use this categorization criteria as their baseline standard. If a member requires a more restrictive categorization for a class of data due to state, federal or other agreements, the more restrictive categorization will apply.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This categorization criteria will be used to assess information access and security requirements for information to be stored or processed within member shared information centers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When determining security controls to use for a given set of information, Information Owners and Custodians should also assess whether special requirements exist regarding importance of information availability and integrity and rate the need as LOW, MODERATE, or HIGH for both availability and integrity. The needs regarding availability and integrity may impact security control decisions but are not used for purposes of assigning a categorization label of Confidential, Internal Use, or Public Information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some classes of information may have attributes, such as “mission critical” or “business critical”. Information attributes do not supplant these classifications but should be used to clarify their importance to the institution.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Using the table above, any set of information can be assigned three security ratings: one for Confidentiality (LOW, MODERATE or HIGH), another for Integrity (LOW, MODERATE or HIGH), and a third for Availability (LOW, MODERATE or HIGH). This is useful for defining security controls in cases where, for example, a set of information may have a low need for confidentiality (LOW impact) but require HIGH availability. In this example, encryption may not be appropriate, but redundancy may be a requirement.</p>

<p>Most breaches that cause HIGH impact are a result of unauthorized access to Confidential information. Therefore, this document and System member assignment of categorization places prime importance on the level of Confidentiality required of the information.</p>
