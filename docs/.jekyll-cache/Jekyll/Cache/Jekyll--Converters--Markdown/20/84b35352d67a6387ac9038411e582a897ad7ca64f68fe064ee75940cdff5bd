I"u<p>The <a href="#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455">PRIVACT</a> establishes requirements for federal and non-federal agencies if they engage in a matching program. In general, a matching program is a computerized comparison of records from two or more automated <a href="#18e71fec-c6fd-475a-925a-5d8495cf8455">PRIVACT</a> systems of records or an automated system of records and automated records maintained by a non-federal agency (or agent thereof). A matching program either pertains to federal benefit programs or federal personnel or payroll records. A federal benefit match is performed to determine or verify eligibility for payments under federal benefit programs or to recoup payments or delinquent debts under federal benefit programs. A matching program involves not just the matching activity itself but also the investigative follow-up and ultimate action, if any.</p>
