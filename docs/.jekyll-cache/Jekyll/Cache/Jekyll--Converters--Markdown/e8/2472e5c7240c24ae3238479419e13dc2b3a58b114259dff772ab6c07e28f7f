I"_<p>Content filtering is the process of inspecting information as it traverses a cross-domain solution and determines if the information meets a predefined security policy. An orchestration engine coordinates the sequencing of activities (manual and automated) in a content filtering process. Errors are defined as either anomalous actions or unexpected termination of the content filter process. This is not the same as a filter failing content due to non-compliance with policy. Content filter reports are a commonly used mechanism to ensure that expected filtering actions are completed successfully.</p>
