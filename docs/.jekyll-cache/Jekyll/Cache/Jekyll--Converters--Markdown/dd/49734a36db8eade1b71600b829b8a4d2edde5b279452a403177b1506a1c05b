I"P%<p><strong>These guidelines are effective October 15, 2021.</strong></p>

<p>This document provides guidance to Texas A&amp;M University System institutions and agencies for submitting incident notifications to the Texas A&amp;M System Office of Cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Title 1 Texas Administrative Code §202.1 defines “security incident” as “an event which results in the accidental or deliberate unauthorized access, loss, disclosure, modification, disruption, or destruction of information or information resources.” [<a href="https://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&amp;app=9&amp;p_dir=&amp;p_rloc=&amp;p_tloc=&amp;p_ploc=&amp;pg=1&amp;p_tac=&amp;ti=1&amp;pt=10&amp;ch=202&amp;rl=1" title="1 TAC §202.1">1</a>] Texas A&amp;M System cybersecurity control standard IR-6 [<a href="https://cyber-standards.tamus.edu/control-catalog/ir#ir-6" title="TAMUS Cybersecurity Control Standard IR-6">2</a>] requires system members to notify the System Office of Cybersecurity and consult with the System Chief Information Security Officer regarding information security incidents involving their information and information systems, whether managed by the agency/institution, contractor, or other source. This includes privacy incidents that do not impact information systems and any incidents involving industrial control systems or operational technology.</p>

<p>These guidelines support the Texas A&amp;M System Office of Cybersecurity in executing its mission objectives and provide the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Greater quality of information</strong> – Alignment with incident reporting and handling guidance from NIST 800-61 Revision 2 to introduce functional, informational, and recoverability impact classifications.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved information sharing and situational awareness</strong> – Establishing a 4-hour notification time frame for all incidents to improve the System Office of Cybersecurity’s ability to understand cybersecurity events affecting the system and make timely required notifications to other system offices.</li>
  <li><strong>Faster incident response times</strong> – Moving cause analysis to the closing phase of the incident handling process to expedite initial notification.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="notification-requirement">Notification Requirement</h1>

<p>System members must report information security incidents where the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a major system-owned or -managed information system, or a system processing confidential information, is potentially compromised to the System Office of Cybersecurity with the required data elements, as well as any other available information, within <strong>four hours</strong> of being identified by the member or the Security Operations Center (SOC).</p>

<p>In some cases, it may not be feasible to have complete and validated information for the section below (<a href="#submitting-incident-notifications">Submitting Incident Notifications</a>) prior to reporting. System members should provide their best estimate at the time of notification and report updated information as it becomes available. Events that have been found by the reporting system member not to impact confidentiality, integrity or availability may be reported voluntarily.</p>

<h1 id="submitting-incident-notifications">Submitting Incident Notifications</h1>

<p>The information elements described in steps 1-5 below are required when notifying the System Office of Cybersecurity of an incident:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify the current level of impact on system member functions or services (Functional Impact).</li>
  <li>Identify the type of information lost, compromised, or corrupted (Information Impact).</li>
  <li>Estimate the scope of time and resources needed to recover from the incident (Recoverability).</li>
  <li>Identify when the activity was first detected.</li>
  <li>Identify point of contact information for additional follow-up.</li>
  <li>Submit the notification to the System Office of Cybersecurity via the Information Security Incident Reporting Portal at <a href="https://cyber-infosharing.tamus.edu">https://cyber-infosharing.tamus.edu</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="impact-category-descriptions">Impact Category Descriptions</h1>

<p>The table below defines each impact category description and its associated severity levels. Use the tables below to identify impact levels and incident details.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Incidents may affect multiple types of data; therefore, system members may select multiple options when identifying the information impact. The security categorization of information and information systems must be determined in accordance with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 199. Specific thresholds for loss-of-service availability (e.g., all, subset, loss of efficiency) must be defined by the reporting organization. Contact the System Research Security Office for guidance on responding to classified data spillage.</p>

      <td><strong>Information Impact</strong> – Describes the type of information lost, compromised, or corrupted</td>
      <td>NO IMPACT – No known data impact.<br /><br />SUSPECTED BUT NOT IDENTIFIED – A data loss or impact to availability is suspected, but no direct confirmation exists.<br /><br />PRIVACY DATA BREACH – The confidentiality of personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive personal information (SPI) was compromised.<br /><br />PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BREACH – The confidentiality of unclassified proprietary information, such as protected critical infrastructure information (PCII), intellectual property, or trade secrets was compromised.<br /><br />DESTRUCTION OF NON-CRITICAL SYSTEMS – Destructive techniques, such as master boot record (MBR) overwrite; have been used against a non-critical system.<br /><br />CRITICAL SYSTEMS DATA BREACH - Data pertaining to a critical system has been exfiltrated.<br /><br />CORE CREDENTIAL COMPROMISE – Core system credentials (such as domain or enterprise administrative credentials) or credentials for critical systems have been exfiltrated.<br /><br />DESTRUCTION OF CRITICAL SYSTEM – Destructive techniques, such as MBR overwrite; have been used against a critical system.</td>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Recoverability</strong> – Identifies the scope of resources needed to recover from the incident</td>
      <td>REGULAR – Time to recovery is predictable with existing resources.<br /><br />SUPPLEMENTED – Time to recovery is predictable with additional resources.<br /><br />EXTENDED – Time to recovery is unpredictable; additional resources and outside help are needed.<br /><br />NOT RECOVERABLE – Recovery from the incident is not possible (e.g., sensitive data exfiltrated and posted publicly).</td>
