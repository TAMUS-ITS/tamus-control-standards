I"„<p>Depending on the criticality of the incident, it will not always be feasible to gather all the information prior to reporting. In such cases, incident response teams should continue to report information to the department as it is collected. The department shall instruct state organizations as to the manner in which they shall report such information to the department. Supporting vendors or other third parties that report security incident information to a state organization shall submit such reports to the state organization in the form and manner specified by the department, unless otherwise directed by the state organization.</p>
