I"Ã<p>Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are conducted by individuals who communicate through either an external or internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are carried out by individuals who are physically present at the system location and not communicating across a network connection. Authentication techniques used to establish nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access requirements in <a href="#ia-2">IA-2</a>. Strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multi-factor authentication. Strong authenticators include PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric. Enforcing requirements in <a href="#ma-4">MA-4</a> is accomplished, in part, by other controls. <a href="#e59c5a7c-8b1f-49ca-8de0-6ee0882180ce">SP 800-63B</a> provides additional guidance on strong authentication and authenticators.</p>
