I"j<p>Developer security and privacy architecture and design are directed at external developers, although they could also be applied to internal (in-house) development. In contrast, <a href="#pl-8">PL-8</a> is directed at internal developers to ensure that organizations develop a security and privacy architecture that is integrated with the enterprise architecture. The distinction between SA-17 and <a href="#pl-8">PL-8</a> is especially important when organizations outsource the development of systems, system components, or system services and when there is a requirement to demonstrate consistency with the enterprise architecture and security and privacy architecture of the organization. <a href="#87087451-2af5-43d4-88c1-d66ad850f614">ISO 15408-2</a>, <a href="#4452efc0-e79e-47b8-aa30-b54f3ef61c2f">ISO 15408-3</a>, and <a href="#e3cc0520-a366-4fc9-abc2-5272db7e3564">SP 800-160-1</a> provide information on security architecture and design, including formal policy models, security-relevant components, formal and informal correspondence, conceptually simple design, and structuring for least privilege and testing.</p>
