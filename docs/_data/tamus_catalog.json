Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented\n               by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the\n               information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the\n               requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring\n               administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny\n               by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner,\n               or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts and\n               privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other\n               attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes\n               required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day,\n               day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations\n               consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades)\n               and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer\n               requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider\n               these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency\n               accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary\n               accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for\n               short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation.\n               Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with\n               the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may\n               bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are\n               not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used\n               for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are\n               unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic\n               disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts\n               include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no\n               longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types\n               of information system accounts may require specialized training.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"related","text":"AC-4"},{"href":"#ac-5","rel":"related","text":"AC-5"},{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related","text":"AC-6"},{"href":"#ac-10","rel":"related","text":"AC-10"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related","text":"AC-19"},{"href":"#ac-20","rel":"related","text":"AC-20"},{"href":"#au-9","rel":"related","text":"AU-9"},{"href":"#ia-2","rel":"related","text":"IA-2"},{"href":"#ia-4","rel":"related","text":"IA-4"},{"href":"#ia-5","rel":"related","text":"IA-5"},{"href":"#ia-8","rel":"related","text":"IA-8"},{"href":"#cm-5","rel":"related","text":"CM-5"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","text":"CM-6"},{"href":"#cm-11","rel":"related","text":"CM-11"},{"href":"#ma-3","rel":"related","text":"MA-3"},{"href":"#ma-4","rel":"related","text":"MA-4"},{"href":"#ma-5","rel":"related","text":"MA-5"},{"href":"#pl-4","rel":"related","text":"PL-4"},{"href":"#sc-13","rel":"related","text":"SC-13"}]},{"id":"ac-2_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine

Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping\n               export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet,\n               blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting\n               web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and\n               limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and\n               content. Transferring information between information systems representing different\n               security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers\n               violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information\n               owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between\n               interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural\n               solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes,\n               for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems\n               (i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way\n               information flows; and (iii) implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to\n               reassign security attributes and security labels. Organizations commonly employ\n               information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of\n               information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals,\n               and devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow\n               control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information\n               path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g.,\n               gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or\n               establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a\n               packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering\n               capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using\n               document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of\n               filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components)\n               that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22\n               primarily address cross-domain solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering\n               techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented\n               in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are\n               generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information technology\n               products.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related","text":"AC-19"},{"href":"#ac-21","rel":"related","text":"AC-21"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","text":"CM-6"},{"href":"#cm-7","rel":"related","text":"CM-7"},{"href":"#sa-8","rel":"related","text":"SA-8"},{"href":"#sc-2","rel":"related","text":"SC-2"},{"href":"#sc-5","rel":"related","text":"SC-5"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related","text":"SC-7"},{"href":"#sc-18","rel":"related","text":"SC-18"}]},{"id":"ac-4_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if:","parts":[{"id":"ac-4_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-4[1]"}],"prose":"the organization defines information flow control policies to control the flow of\n                  information within the system and between interconnected systems; and"},{"id":"ac-4_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-4[2]"}],"prose":"the information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow\n                  of information within the system and between interconnected systems based on\n                  organization-defined information flow control policies."}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Access control policy\\n\\ninformation flow control policies\\n\\nprocedures addressing information flow enforcement\\n\\ninformation system design documentation\\n\\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\\n\\ninformation system baseline configuration\\n\\nlist of information flow authorizations\\n\\ninformation system audit records\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"System/network administrators\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\\n\\nsystem developers"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy"}]}]},{"id":"ac-5","class":"SP800-53","title":"Separation of Duties","parameters":[{"id":"ac-5_prm_1","label":"organization-defined duties of individuals"}],"properties":[{"name":"baseline","value":"MOD, HIGH"},{"name":"required_by","value":"February 2015"},{"name":"priority","value":"P1"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-5"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ac-05"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-5_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization:","parts":[{"id":"ac-5_smt.a","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"a."}],"prose":"Separates {{ ac-5_prm_1 }};"},{"id":"ac-5_smt.b","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"b."}],"prose":"Documents separation of duties of individuals; and"},{"id":"ac-5_smt.c","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"c."}],"prose":"Defines information system access authorizations to support separation of\n                  duties."},{"id":"ac-5_tx","name":"item","title":"State Implementation","parts":[{"id":"ac-5_tx_smt.1","name":"item","prose":"State organizations shall ensure adequate controls and separation of duties for tasks that are susceptible to fraudulent or other unauthorized activity."}]}]},{"id":"ac-5_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and\n               helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion.

Security attributes when bound to\n               data/information, enables the enforcement of information security policies for access\n               control and information flow control, either through organizational processes or\n               information system functions or mechanisms. The content or assigned values of\n               security attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access\n               organizational information. Organizations can define the types of attributes needed\n               for selected information systems to support missions/business functions. There is\n               potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to any given security\n               attribute. Release markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or NOFORN (not\n               releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and\n               values, organizations can ensure that the security attribute values are meaningful\n               and relevant. The term security labeling refers to the association of security\n               attributes with subjects and objects represented by internal data structures within\n               organizational information systems, to enable information system-based enforcement of\n               information security policies. Security labels include, for example, access\n               authorizations, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration),\n               nationality, affiliation as contractor, and classification of information in\n               accordance with legal and compliance requirements. The term security marking refers\n               to the association of security attributes with objects in a human-readable form, to\n               enable organizational process-based enforcement of information security policies. The\n               AC-16 base control represents the requirement for user-based attribute association\n               (marking). The enhancements to AC-16 represent additional requirements including\n               information system-based attribute association (labeling). Types of attributes\n               include, for example, classification level for objects and clearance (access\n               authorization) level for subjects. An example of a value for both of these attribute\n               types is Top Secret.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"related","text":"AC-4"},{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related","text":"AC-6"},{"href":"#ac-21","rel":"related","text":"AC-21"},{"href":"#au-2","rel":"related","text":"AU-2"},{"href":"#au-10","rel":"related","text":"AU-10"},{"href":"#sc-16","rel":"related","text":"SC-16"},{"href":"#mp-3","rel":"related","text":"MP-3"}]},{"id":"ac-16_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"ac-16.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-16(a)"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-16.a_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-16(a)[1]"}],"prose":"defines types of security attributes to be associated with information:","parts":[{"id":"ac-16.a_obj.1.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-16(a)[1][a]"}],"prose":"in storage;"},{"id":"ac-16.a_obj.1.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-16(a)[1][b]"}],"prose":"in process;

Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and\n               wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to\n               enhance confidentiality and integrity over remote connections.

External information systems include, for example: (i) personally\n               owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, tablets,\n               personal digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and communications\n               devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations,\n               convention centers, shopping malls, or airports); (iii) information systems owned or\n               controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information\n               systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and\n               authority of organizations. This control also addresses the use of external\n               information systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of organizational\n               information, including, for example, accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure\n               as a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational\n               information systems. For some external information systems (i.e., information systems\n               operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate to those\n               agencies), the trust relationships that have been established between those\n               organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms\n               and conditions are required. Information systems within these organizations would not\n               be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are\n               pre-existing sharing/trust agreements (either implicit or explicit) established\n               between federal agencies or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such\n               trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or\n               policies. Authorized individuals include, for example, organizational personnel,\n               contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational\n               information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose rules\n               of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on\n               authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending\n               upon the trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may\n               choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local,\n               or tribal governments. This control does not apply to the use of external information\n               systems to access public interfaces to organizational information systems (e.g.,\n               individuals accessing federal information through www.usa.gov). Organizations\n               establish terms and conditions for the use of external information systems in\n               accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions\n               address as a minimum: types of applications that can be accessed on organizational\n               information systems from external information systems; and the highest security\n               category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external\n               information systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external information\n               systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on\n               organizational personnel using those external systems.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related","text":"AC-19"},{"href":"#ca-3","rel":"related","text":"CA-3"},{"href":"#pl-4","rel":"related","text":"PL-4"},{"href":"#sa-9","rel":"related","text":"SA-9"}]},{"id":"ac-20_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any\n               trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or\n               maintaining external information systems, allowing authorized individuals to: ","parts":[{"id":"ac-20.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20(a)"}],"prose":"access the information system from the external information systems; and"},{"id":"ac-20.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-20(b)"}],"prose":"process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external\n                  information systems."}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Access control policy\\n\\nprocedures addressing the use of external information systems\\n\\nexternal information systems terms and conditions\\n\\nlist of types of applications accessible from external information systems\\n\\nmaximum security categorization for information processed, stored, or transmitted\n                  on external information systems\\n\\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with responsibilities for defining terms and conditions\n                  for use of external information systems to access organizational systems\\n\\nsystem/network administrators\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms implementing terms and conditions on use of external\n                  information systems"}]}]},{"id":"ac-21","class":"SP800-53","title":"Information Sharing","parameters":[{"id":"ac-21_prm_1","label":"organization-defined information sharing circumstances where user discretion is\n               required"},{"id":"ac-21_prm_2","label":"organization-defined automated mechanisms or manual processes"}],"properties":[{"name":"baseline","value":"MOD, HIGH"},{"name":"priority","value":"P2"},{"name":"label","value":"AC-21"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ac-21"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-21_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization:","parts":[{"id":"ac-21_smt.a","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"a."}],"prose":"Facilitates information sharing by enabling authorized users to determine whether\n                  access authorizations assigned to the sharing partner match the access\n                  restrictions on the information for {{ ac-21_prm_1 }}; and"},{"id":"ac-21_smt.b","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"b."}],"prose":"Employs {{ ac-21_prm_2 }} to assist users in making information\n                  sharing/collaboration decisions."}]},{"id":"ac-21_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"This control applies to information that may be restricted in some manner (e.g.,\n               privileged medical information, contract-sensitive information, proprietary\n               information, personally identifiable information, classified information related to\n               special access programs or compartments) based on some formal or administrative\n               determination.

Audit events can\n               include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed accesses related to\n               information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, or\n               third-party credential usage. In determining the set of auditable events,\n               organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to\n               be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs,\n               this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are\n               audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that\n               information systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful\n               and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances\n               due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements, including\n               the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and\n               control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required\n               by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and\n               standards. Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including\n               at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate\n               level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate\n               the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the\n               definition of auditable events, the auditing necessary to cover related events such\n               as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are\n               distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented\n               architectures.","links":[{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related","text":"AC-6"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#au-3","rel":"related","text":"AU-3"},{"href":"#au-12","rel":"related","text":"AU-12"},{"href":"#ma-4","rel":"related","text":"MA-4"},{"href":"#mp-2","rel":"related","text":"MP-2"},{"href":"#mp-4","rel":"related","text":"MP-4"},{"href":"#si-4","rel":"related","text":"SI-4"}]},{"id":"au-2_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"au-2.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(a)"}],"parts":[{"id":"au-2.a_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(a)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the auditable events that the information system must be capable of\n                     auditing;"},{"id":"au-2.a_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(a)[2]"}],"prose":"determines that the information system is capable of auditing\n                     organization-defined auditable events;"}]},{"id":"au-2.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(b)"}],"prose":"coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities\n                  requiring audit-related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide\n                  the selection of auditable events;"},{"id":"au-2.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(c)"}],"prose":"provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate to\n                  support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents;"},{"id":"au-2.d_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(d)"}],"parts":[{"id":"au-2.d_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(d)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the subset of auditable events defined in AU-2a that are to be audited\n                     within the information system;"},{"id":"au-2.d_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(d)[2]"}],"prose":"determines that the subset of auditable events defined in AU-2a are to be\n                     audited within the information system;

Security assessments: (i) ensure\n               that information security is built into organizational information systems; (ii)\n               identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in the development process; (iii) provide\n               essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part of security\n               authorization processes; and (iv) ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation\n               procedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security controls from\n               Appendix F (main catalog) and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented\n               in System Security Plans and Information Security Program Plans.

Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient\n               detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and\n               completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are implemented\n               correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to\n               meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement for assessing security controls\n               at least annually does not require additional assessment activities to those\n               activities already in place in organizational security authorization processes.\n               Security assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for\n               the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in\n               support of security authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials or\n               authorizing official designated representatives. To satisfy annual assessment\n               requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following sources:\n               (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations; (ii) continuous monitoring;\n               or (iii) system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security\n               assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of security control\n               effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence.\n               Existing security control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the\n               results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as\n               needed.

Authorizing officials provide budgetary oversight for\n               organizational information systems or assume responsibility for the mission/business\n               operations supported by those systems. The security authorization process is an\n               inherently federal responsibility and therefore, authorizing officials must be\n               federal employees.

To reduce the administrative cost of security\n               reauthorization, authorizing officials use the results of continuous monitoring\n               processes to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering reauthorization\n               decisions.","links":[{"href":"#ca-2","rel":"related","text":"CA-2"},{"href":"#ca-7","rel":"related","text":"CA-7"},{"href":"#pm-9","rel":"related","text":"PM-9"},{"href":"#pm-10","rel":"related","text":"PM-10"}]},{"id":"ca-6_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"ca-6.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-6(a)"}],"prose":"assigns a senior-level executive or manager as the authorizing official for the\n                  information system;"},{"id":"ca-6.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-6(b)"}],"prose":"ensures that the authorizing official authorizes the information system for\n                  processing before commencing operations;"},{"id":"ca-6.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-6(c)"}],"parts":[{"id":"ca-6.c_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-6(c)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the frequency to update the security authorization;

conducted on information\n               systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be\n               exploited by adversaries. Such testing can be used to either validate vulnerabilities\n               or determine the degree of resistance organizational information systems have to\n               adversaries within a set of specified constraints (e.g., time, resources, and/or\n               skills). Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries in\n               carrying out hostile cyber attacks against organizations and provides a more in-depth\n               analysis of security-related weaknesses/deficiencies. Organizations can also use the\n               results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities.\n               Penetration testing can be conducted on the hardware, software, or firmware\n               components of an information system and can exercise both physical and technical\n               security controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes, for example:\n               (i) pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the target system; (ii) pretest\n               identification of potential vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis; and (iii)\n               testing designed to determine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities. All\n               parties agree to the rules of engagement before the commencement of penetration\n               testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the penetration testing rules of\n               engagement with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be\n               employed by adversaries carrying out attacks.

The\n               established settings become part of the systems configuration baseline. Common secure\n               configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and\n               hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation\n               guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate\n               secure configuration settings for specific information technology platforms/products\n               and instructions for configuring those information system components to meet\n               operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety\n               of organizations including, for example, information technology product developers,\n               manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other\n               organizations in the public and private sectors. Common secure configurations include\n               the United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB) which affects the\n               implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security\n               Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol\n               (e.g., Common Configuration Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely\n               identify, track, and control configuration settings. OMB establishes federal policy\n               on configuration requirements for federal information systems.","links":[{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related","text":"AC-19"},{"href":"#cm-2","rel":"related","text":"CM-2"},{"href":"#cm-3","rel":"related","text":"CM-3"},{"href":"#cm-7","rel":"related","text":"CM-7"},{"href":"#si-4","rel":"related","text":"SI-4"}]},{"id":"cm-6_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"cm-6.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(a)"}],"parts":[{"id":"cm-6.a_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(a)[1]"}],"prose":"defines security configuration checklists to be used to establish and document\n                     configuration settings for the information technology products employed;"},{"id":"cm-6.a_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(a)[2]"}],"prose":"ensures the defined security configuration checklists reflect the most\n                     restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements;"},{"id":"cm-6.a_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(a)[3]"}],"prose":"establishes and documents configuration settings for information technology\n                     products employed within the information system using organization-defined\n                     security configuration checklists;"}]},{"id":"cm-6.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(b)"}],"prose":"implements the configuration settings established/documented in CM-6(a);;"},{"id":"cm-6.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(c)"}],"parts":[{"id":"cm-6.c_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(c)[1]"}],"prose":"defines information system components for which any deviations from established\n                     configuration settings must be:","parts":[{"id":"cm-6.c_obj.1.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(c)[1][a]"}],"prose":"identified;"},{"id":"cm-6.c_obj.1.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(c)[1][b]"}],"prose":"documented;"},{"id":"cm-6.c_obj.1.c","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(c)[1][c]"}],"prose":"approved;"}]},{"id":"cm-6.c_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(c)[2]"}],"prose":"defines operational requirements to support:","parts":[{"id":"cm-6.c_obj.2.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(c)[2][a]"}],"prose":"the identification of any deviations from established configuration\n                        settings;"},{"id":"cm-6.c_obj.2.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(c)[2][b]"}],"prose":"the documentation of any deviations from established configuration\n                        settings;"},{"id":"cm-6.c_obj.2.c","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(c)[2][c]"}],"prose":"the approval of any deviations from established configuration settings;"}]},{"id":"cm-6.c_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(c)[3]"}],"prose":"identifies any deviations from established configuration settings for\n                     organization-defined information system components based on\n                     organizational-defined operational requirements;"},{"id":"cm-6.c_obj.4","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(c)[4]"}],"prose":"documents any deviations from established configuration settings for\n                     organization-defined information system components based on\n                     organizational-defined operational requirements;"},{"id":"cm-6.c_obj.5","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(c)[5]"}],"prose":"approves any deviations from established configuration settings for\n                     organization-defined information system components based on\n                     organizational-defined operational requirements;"}]},{"id":"cm-6.d_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(d)"}],"parts":[{"id":"cm-6.d_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-6(d)[1]"}],"prose":"monitors changes to the configuration settings in accordance with\n                     organizational policies and procedures;

The\n               effectiveness of contingency planning is maximized by considering such planning\n               throughout the phases of the system development life cycle.

By closely coordinating contingency planning with incident\n               handling activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency planning\n               activities are in place

This control\n               applies to all accesses other than: (i) accesses that are explicitly identified and\n               documented in AC-14; and (ii) accesses that occur through authorized use of group\n               authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique\n               identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or\n               for detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords,\n               tokens, or biometrics to authenticate user identities, or in the case multifactor\n               authentication, or some combination thereof. Access to organizational information\n               systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any\n               access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf\n               of users) where such access is obtained by direct connections without the use of\n               networks. Network access is access to organizational information systems by users (or\n               processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained through network\n               connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that\n               involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Internal\n               networks include local area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of\n               encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) for network connections between\n               organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be\n               treated as internal networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality\n               and integrity of information traversing the network. Organizations can satisfy the\n               identification and authentication requirements in this control by complying with the\n               requirements in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with the\n               specific organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires the\n               use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The factors are\n               defined as: (i) something you know (e.g., password, personal identification number\n               [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token);\n               or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor solutions that require\n               devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example,\n               hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart\n               cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD\n               common access card. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the\n               information system level (i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification\n               and authentication mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide\n               increased information security.

Security plans contain sufficient information (including\n               the specification of parameter values for assignment and selection statements either\n               explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is\n               unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of\n               risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and\n               the Nation if the plan is implemented as intended.

The information security architecture at the individual\n               information system level is consistent with and complements the more global,\n               organization-wide information security architecture described in PM-7 that is\n               integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The information\n               security architecture includes an architectural description, the placement/allocation\n               of security functionality (including security controls), security-related information\n               for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the\n               protection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition, the security\n               architecture can include other important security-related information, for example,\n               user roles and access privileges assigned to each role, unique security requirements,\n               the types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the information\n               system, restoration priorities of information and information system services, and\n               any other specific protection needs. In today’s modern architecture, it is becoming\n               less common for organizations to control all information resources. There are going\n               to be key dependencies on external information services and service providers.\n               Describing such dependencies in the information security architecture is important to\n               developing a comprehensive mission/business protection strategy. Establishing,\n               developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline\n               configuration for organizational information systems is critical to implementing and\n               maintaining an effective information security architecture. The development of the\n               information security architecture is coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for\n               Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to ensure that security controls needed to\n               support privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. PL-8 is\n               primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure that\n               organizations develop an information security architecture for the information\n               system, and that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to\n               the enterprise architecture through the organization-wide information security\n               architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at external information\n               technology product/system developers and integrators (although SA-17 could be used\n               internally within organizations for in-house system development). SA-17, which is\n               complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of\n               information systems or information system components to external entities, and there\n               is a need to demonstrate/show consistency with the organization’s enterprise\n               architecture and information security architecture.","links":[{"href":"#cm-2","rel":"related","text":"CM-2"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","text":"CM-6"},{"href":"#pl-2","rel":"related","text":"PL-2"},{"href":"#pm-7","rel":"related","text":"PM-7"},{"href":"#sa-5","rel":"related","text":"SA-5"},{"href":"#sa-17","rel":"related","text":"SA-17"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r4","rel":"related","text":"Appendix J"}]},{"id":"pl-8_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization: ","parts":[{"id":"pl-8.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)"}],"prose":"develops an information security architecture for the information system that\n                  describes:","parts":[{"id":"pl-8.a.1_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)(1)"}],"prose":"the overall philosophy, requirements, and approach to be taken with regard to\n                     protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational\n                     information;"},{"id":"pl-8.a.2_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)(2)"}],"prose":"how the information security architecture is integrated into and supports the\n                     enterprise architecture;"},{"id":"pl-8.a.3_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)(3)"}],"prose":"any information security assumptions about, and dependencies on, external\n                     services;"}]},{"id":"pl-8.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(b)"}],"parts":[{"id":"pl-8.b_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(b)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the frequency to review and update the information security\n                     architecture;"},{"id":"pl-8.b_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(b)[2]"}],"prose":"reviews and updates the information security architecture with the\n                     organization-defined frequency to reflect updates in the enterprise\n                     architecture;"}]},{"id":"pl-8.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(c)"}],"prose":"ensures that planned information security architecture changes are reflected\n                  in:","parts":[{"id":"pl-8.c_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(c)[1]"}],"prose":"the security plan;"},{"id":"pl-8.c_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(c)[2]"}],"prose":"the security Concept of Operations (CONOPS);

Security\n               properties of information systems may be affected by the interconnection of system\n               components or changes to those components. These interconnections or changes (e.g.,\n               upgrading or replacing applications and operating systems) may adversely affect\n               previously implemented security controls. This control provides additional types of\n               security testing/evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate\n               potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as\n               static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three\n               approaches.

Organizations use the\n               acquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to implement\n               necessary security safeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized\n               modifications at each stage in the supply chain; and (ii) protect information systems\n               and information system components, prior to taking delivery of such\n               systems/components. This control also applies to information system services.\n               Security safeguards include, for example: (i) security controls for development\n               systems, development facilities, and external connections to development systems;\n               (ii) vetting development personnel; and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during\n               shipping/warehousing. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans,\n               evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or\n               classification level of the information system. Contracts may specify documentation\n               protection requirements.","links":[{"href":"#at-3","rel":"related","text":"AT-3"},{"href":"#cm-8","rel":"related","text":"CM-8"},{"href":"#ir-4","rel":"related","text":"IR-4"},{"href":"#pe-16","rel":"related","text":"PE-16"},{"href":"#pl-8","rel":"related","text":"PL-8"},{"href":"#sa-3","rel":"related","text":"SA-3"},{"href":"#sa-4","rel":"related","text":"SA-4"},{"href":"#sa-8","rel":"related","text":"SA-8"},{"href":"#sa-10","rel":"related","text":"SA-10"},{"href":"#sa-14","rel":"related","text":"SA-14"},{"href":"#sa-15","rel":"related","text":"SA-15"},{"href":"#sa-18","rel":"related","text":"SA-18"},{"href":"#sa-19","rel":"related","text":"SA-19"},{"href":"#sc-29","rel":"related","text":"SC-29"},{"href":"#sc-30","rel":"related","text":"SC-30"},{"href":"#sc-38","rel":"related","text":"SC-38"},{"href":"#si-7","rel":"related","text":"SI-7"}]},{"id":"sa-12_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"sa-12_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-12[1]"}],"prose":"defines security safeguards to be employed to protect against supply chain threats\n                  to the information system, system component, or information system service;\n                  and"},{"id":"sa-12_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-12[2]"}],"prose":"protects against supply chain threats to the information system, system component,\n                  or information system service by employing organization-defined security\n                  safeguards as part of a comprehensive, defense-in-breadth information security\n                  strategy."}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"System and services acquisition policy\\n\\nprocedures addressing supply chain protection\\n\\nprocedures addressing the integration of information security requirements into\n                  the acquisition process\\n\\nsolicitation documentation\\n\\nacquisition documentation\\n\\nservice-level agreements\\n\\nacquisition contracts for the information system, system component, or information\n                  system service\\n\\nlist of supply chain threats\\n\\nlist of security safeguards to be taken against supply chain threats\\n\\nsystem development life cycle documentation\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with system and services acquisition responsibilities\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\\n\\norganizational personnel with supply chain protection responsibilities"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational processes for defining safeguards for and protecting against supply\n                  chain threats\\n\\nautomated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing safeguards for supply chain\n                  threats"}]}]},{"id":"sa-13","class":"SP800-53","title":"Trustworthiness","parameters":[{"id":"sa-13_prm_1","label":"organization-defined information system, information system component, or\n               information system service"},{"id":"sa-13_prm_2","label":"organization-defined assurance overlay"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-13"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"sa-13"}],"links":[{"href":"#e85cdb3f-7f0a-4083-8639-f13f70d3760b","rel":"reference","text":"FIPS Publication 199"},{"href":"#aba82822-b6e6-4abe-af2e-3fdd68f0bcf8","rel":"reference","text":"FIPS Publication 200"},{"href":"#07b79057-4b85-471e-bd16-84844917325b","rel":"reference","text":"NIST Special Publication 800-53"},{"href":"#cd4cf751-3312-4a55-b1a9-fad2f1db9119","rel":"reference","text":"NIST Special Publication 800-53A"},{"href":"#f152844f-b1ef-4836-8729-6277078ebee1","rel":"reference","text":"NIST Special Publication 800-60"},{"href":"#abd950ae-092f-4b7a-b374-1c7c67fe9350","rel":"reference","text":"NIST Special Publication 800-64"}],"parts":[{"id":"sa-13_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization:","parts":[{"id":"sa-13_smt.a","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"a."}],"prose":"Describes the trustworthiness required in the {{ sa-13_prm_1 }}\n                  supporting its critical missions/business functions; and"},{"id":"sa-13_smt.b","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"b."}],"prose":"Implements {{ sa-13_prm_2 }} to achieve such trustworthiness."}]},{"id":"sa-13_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"This control helps organizations to make explicit trustworthiness decisions when\n               designing, developing, and implementing information systems that are needed to\n               conduct critical organizational missions/business functions. Trustworthiness is a\n               characteristic/property of an information system that expresses the degree to which\n               the system can be expected to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and\n               availability of the information it processes, stores, or transmits. Trustworthy\n               information systems are systems that are capable of being trusted to operate within\n               defined levels of risk despite the environmental disruptions, human errors, and\n               purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in the specified environments of\n               operation. Trustworthy systems are important to mission/business success. Two factors\n               affecting the trustworthiness of information systems include: (i) security\n               functionality (i.e., the security features, functions, and/or mechanisms employed\n               within the system and its environment of operation); and (ii) security assurance\n               (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security functionality is effective in its\n               application). Developers, implementers, operators, and maintainers of organizational\n               information systems can increase the level of assurance (and trustworthiness), for\n               example, by employing well-defined security policy models, structured and rigorous\n               hardware, software, and firmware development techniques, sound system/security\n               engineering principles, and secure configuration settings (defined by a set of\n               assurance-related security controls in Appendix E). Assurance is also based on the\n               assessment of evidence produced during the system development life cycle. Critical\n               missions/business functions are supported by high-impact systems and the associated\n               assurance requirements for such systems. The additional assurance controls in Table\n               E-4 in Appendix E (designated as optional) can be used to develop and implement\n               high-assurance solutions for specific information systems and system components using\n               the concept of overlays described in Appendix I. Organizations select assurance\n               overlays that have been developed, validated, and approved for community adoption\n               (e.g., cross-organization, governmentwide), limiting the development of such overlays\n               on an organization-by-organization basis. Organizations can conduct criticality\n               analyses as described in SA-14, to determine the information systems, system\n               components, or information system services that require high-assurance solutions.\n               Trustworthiness requirements and assurance overlays can be described in the security\n               plans for organizational information systems.","links":[{"href":"#ra-2","rel":"related","text":"RA-2"},{"href":"#sa-4","rel":"related","text":"SA-4"},{"href":"#sa-8","rel":"related","text":"SA-8"},{"href":"#sa-14","rel":"related","text":"SA-14"},{"href":"#sc-3","rel":"related","text":"SC-3"}]},{"id":"sa-13_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"sa-13.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-13(a)"}],"parts":[{"id":"sa-13.a_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-13(a)[1]"}],"prose":"defines information system, system component, or information system service for\n                     which the trustworthiness required is to be described;"},{"id":"sa-13.a_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-13(a)[2]"}],"prose":"describes the trustworthiness required in organization-defined information\n                     system, information system component, or information system service supporting\n                     its critical mission/business functions;"}]},{"id":"sa-13.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-13(b)"}],"parts":[{"id":"sa-13.b_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-13(b)[1]"}],"prose":"defines an assurance overlay to be implemented to achieve such trustworthiness;\n                     and"},{"id":"sa-13.b_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-13(b)[2]"}],"prose":"organization implements the organization-defined assurance overlay to achieve\n                     such trustworthiness."}]}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"System and services acquisition policy\\n\\nprocedures addressing trustworthiness requirements for the information system,\n                  system component, or information system service\\n\\nsecurity plan\\n\\ninformation system design documentation\\n\\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\\n\\nsecurity categorization documentation/results\\n\\nsecurity authorization package for the information system, system component, or\n                  information system service\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with system and services acquisition responsibilities\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\\n\\nauthorizing official"}]}]},{"id":"sa-14","class":"SP800-53","title":"Criticality Analysis","parameters":[{"id":"sa-14_prm_1","label":"organization-defined information systems, information system components, or\n               information system services"},{"id":"sa-14_prm_2","label":"organization-defined decision points in the system development life cycle"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-14"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"sa-14"}],"parts":[{"id":"sa-14_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization identifies critical information system components and functions by\n               performing a criticality analysis for {{ sa-14_prm_1 }} at {{ sa-14_prm_2 }}."},{"id":"sa-14_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and informs the\n               prioritization of supply chain protection activities such as attack surface\n               reduction, use of all-source intelligence, and tailored acquisition strategies.\n               Information system engineers can conduct an end-to-end functional decomposition of an\n               information system to identify mission-critical functions and components.

This capability is available in most commercial operating\n               systems that employ multi-state processor technologies.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"related","text":"AC-4"},{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related","text":"AC-6"},{"href":"#sa-4","rel":"related","text":"SA-4"},{"href":"#sa-5","rel":"related","text":"SA-5"},{"href":"#sa-8","rel":"related","text":"SA-8"},{"href":"#sc-2","rel":"related","text":"SC-2"},{"href":"#sc-3","rel":"related","text":"SC-3"}]},{"id":"sc-39_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the information system maintains a separate execution domain for each\n               executing process."},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Information system design documentation\\n\\ninformation system architecture\\n\\nindependent verification and validation documentation\\n\\ntesting and evaluation documentation, other relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Information system developers/integrators\\n\\ninformation system security architect"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing separate execution domains for\n                  each executing process"}]}]},{"id":"sc-40","class":"SP800-53","title":"Wireless Link Protection","parameters":[{"id":"sc-40_prm_1","label":"organization-defined wireless links"},{"id":"sc-40_prm_2","label":"organization-defined types of signal parameter attacks or references to sources\n               for such attacks"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SC-40"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"sc-40"}],"parts":[{"id":"sc-40_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The information system protects external and internal {{ sc-40_prm_1 }} from {{ sc-40_prm_2 }}."},{"id":"sc-40_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"This control applies to internal and external wireless communication links that may\n               be visible to individuals who are not authorized information system users.\n               Adversaries can exploit the signal parameters of wireless links if such links are not\n               adequately protected.

Security-relevant software updates include, for example, patches,\n               service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations also address flaws\n               discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response\n               activities, and system error handling. Organizations take advantage of available\n               resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and\n               Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating flaws discovered in organizational\n               information systems.

Malicious code includes, for example,\n               viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in\n               various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden\n               files, or hidden in files using steganography.

External\n               monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the information system\n               boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal\n               monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the information\n               system. Organizations can monitor information systems, for example, by observing\n               audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access\n               patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may\n               guide determination of the events. Information system monitoring capability is\n               achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection\n               systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning\n               tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic\n               locations for monitoring devices include, for example, selected perimeter locations\n               and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically\n               being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17.\n               Einstein network monitoring devices from the Department of Homeland Security can also\n               be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of monitoring information\n               collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of\n               information systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of\n               interest include, for example, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that\n               bypasses HTTP proxies. Information system monitoring is an integral part of\n               organizational continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output from\n               system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response\n               programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates\n               through a network (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any\n               connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the\n               Internet). Local, network, and remote connections can be either wired or\n               wireless.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"related","text":"AC-4"},{"href":"#ac-8","rel":"related","text":"AC-8"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#au-2","rel":"related","text":"AU-2"},{"href":"#au-6","rel":"related","text":"AU-6"},{"href":"#au-7","rel":"related","text":"AU-7"},{"href":"#au-9","rel":"related","text":"AU-9"},{"href":"#au-12","rel":"related","text":"AU-12"},{"href":"#ca-7","rel":"related","text":"CA-7"},{"href":"#ir-4","rel":"related","text":"IR-4"},{"href":"#pe-3","rel":"related","text":"PE-3"},{"href":"#ra-5","rel":"related","text":"RA-5"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related","text":"SC-7"},{"href":"#sc-26","rel":"related","text":"SC-26"},{"href":"#sc-35","rel":"related","text":"SC-35"},{"href":"#si-3","rel":"related","text":"SI-3"},{"href":"#si-7","rel":"related","text":"SI-7"}]},{"id":"si-4_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine

By implementing the\n               concept of non-persistence for selected information system components, organizations\n               can provide a known state computing resource for a specific period of time that does\n               not give adversaries sufficient time on target to exploit vulnerabilities in\n               organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems\n               operate. Since the advanced persistent threat is a high-end threat with regard to\n               capability, intent, and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period\n               of time, a percentage of cyber attacks will be successful. Non-persistent information\n               system components and services are activated as required using protected information\n               and terminated periodically or upon the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases\n               the work factor of adversaries in attempting to compromise or breach organizational\n               information systems. Non-persistent system components can be implemented, for\n               example, by periodically re-imaging components or by using a variety of common\n               virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services can be implemented using\n               virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines or as new instances of\n               processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent).The benefit of\n               periodic refreshes of information system components/services is that it does not\n               require organizations to first determine whether compromises of components or\n               services have occurred (something that may often be difficult for organizations to\n               determine). The refresh of selected information system components and services occurs\n               with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact of attacks, but\n               not with such frequency that it makes the information system unstable. In some\n               instances, refreshes of critical components and services may be done periodically in\n               order to hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum windows of\n               vulnerabilities.","links":[{"href":"#sc-30","rel":"related","text":"SC-30"},{"href":"#sc-34","rel":"related","text":"SC-34"}]},{"id":"si-14_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"si-14_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-14[1]"}],"prose":"defines non-persistent information system components and services to be\n                  implemented;"},{"id":"si-14_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-14[2]"}],"parts":[{"id":"si-14_obj.2.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-14[2][a]"}],"prose":"defines a frequency to terminate non-persistent organization-defined components\n                     and services that are initiated in a known state;"},{"id":"si-14_obj.2.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-14[2][b]"}],"prose":"implements non-persistent organization-defined information system components\n                     and services that are initiated in a known state and terminated one or more of\n                     the following:","parts":[{"id":"si-14_obj.2.b.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-14[2][b][1]"}],"prose":"upon end of session of use; and/or"},{"id":"si-14_obj.2.b.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-14[2][b][2]"}],"prose":"periodically at the organization-defined frequency."}]}]}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"System and information integrity policy\\n\\nprocedures addressing non-persistence for information system components\\n\\ninformation system design documentation\\n\\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\\n\\ninformation system audit records\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with responsibility for non-persistence\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\\n\\nsystem/network administrators\\n\\nsystem developer"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing initiation and termination of\n                  non-persistent components"}]}]},{"id":"si-15","class":"SP800-53","title":"Information Output Filtering","parameters":[{"id":"si-15_prm_1","label":"organization-defined software programs and/or applications"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-15"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"si-15"}],"parts":[{"id":"si-15_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The information system validates information output from {{ si-15_prm_1 }} to ensure that the information is consistent with the\n               expected content."},{"id":"si-15_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Certain types of cyber attacks (e.g., SQL injections) produce output results that are\n               unexpected or inconsistent with the output results that would normally be expected\n               from software programs or applications.

The standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in\n               classified environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of\n               Controlled Unclassified Information in non-national security systems. Insider threat\n               programs include security controls to detect and prevent malicious insider activity\n               through the centralized integration and analysis of both technical and non-technical\n               information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior organizational\n               official is designated by the department/agency head as the responsible individual to\n               implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized\n               integration and analysis capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare\n               department/agency insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct\n               host-based user monitoring of individual employee activities on government-owned\n               classified computers, provide insider threat awareness training to employees, receive\n               access to information from all offices within the department/agency (e.g., human\n               resources, legal, physical security, personnel security, information technology,\n               information system security, and law enforcement) for insider threat analysis, and\n               conduct self-assessments of department/agency insider threat posture. Insider threat\n               programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams organizations may\n               already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human\n               resources records are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling\n               evidence to show that some types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical\n               behaviors in the workplace (e.g., ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and\n               conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues). These precursors can better inform\n               and guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts.
