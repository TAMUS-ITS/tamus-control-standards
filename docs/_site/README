# How to Update Controls Catalog

_TODO: Instructions for generating the HTML catalog from OSCAL_

1. Strip all content in the output HTML from the top to the `<section class="ToC">` line

2. Strip the </body> and </html> at the bottom of the output HTML

3. Add the following to the top of the output HTML:

```
---
layout: catalog
title: Texas A&M University System Cybersecurity Control Standards Catalog
custom-css: catalog.css
---
```

4. Move the output HTML to `/catalog.html` in the `cyber-standards.tamus.edu` Jekyll working directory (or upload directly to GitHub)
