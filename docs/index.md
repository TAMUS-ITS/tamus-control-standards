# Texas A&M University System Cybersecurity Control Standards

Texas A&M University System members publish a security control catalog to
implement organizational information security controls in a format that aligns
with the Texas Security Control Standards Catalog, prescribed by Title 1 Texas
Administrative Code ยง202.76, Security Control Standards Catalog.

Texas A&M System Cybersecurity Control Standards provide system members with
additional guidance that enhances State-level requirements for implementing
security controls.  These standards are prescribed by Texas A&M System
Regulation 29.01.03, Information Security, paragraph 1.2(c).

This standard is intended to be used as a supplement to Texas Security Control
Standards Catalog Version 1.3, updated February 26, 2016, and is presented in
several formats:

- [The official standard in PDF format](tamus-control-standards.pdf), that presents
  Texas A&M System enhancements to statewide controls, along with appendices

- A combined view, in HTML format, of the NIST SP 800-53 catalog, Texas
  statewide controls, and Texas A&M System enhancements

  - Three variants are available:

    - [sp800-53a+TXDIR+TAMUS+full_catalog.html](sp800-53a+TXDIR+TAMUS+full_catalog.html)
     includes all controls presented in the Texas Security Control Standards
     Catalog

    - [sp800-53a+TXDIR+TAMUS+baseline-controls_catalog.html](sp800-53a+TXDIR+TAMUS+baseline-controls_catalog.html)
     includes only those controls from the Texas Security Control Standards
     Catalog that are part of a LOW, MODERATE, or HIGH baseline

    - [sp800-53a+TXDIR+TAMUS+full-with-enhancements_catalog.html](sp800-53a+TXDIR+TAMUS+full-with-enhancements_catalog.html)
     includes all controls from NIST SP 800-53, including control enhancements

- [Machine-readable data](https://github.com/tamuscyber/tamus-control-standards/tree/master/content),
