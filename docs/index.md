# Texas A&M University System Cybersecurity Control Standards

Texas A&M System Cybersecurity Control Standards provide system members with additional guidance that enhances State-level requirements for implementing security controls. These standards are prescribed by Texas A&M System Regulation 29.01.03, Information Security, paragraph 1.2(c).

[Texas A&M System Cybersecurity Control Standards & Implementation Guide](/static/tamus-control-standards.pdf)

A combined view of the NIST SP 800-53 catalog, Texas statewide control standards, and Texas A&M System control standards is also available in one of these variants:

  - [All controls presented in the Texas Security Control Standards Catalog](/control-catalog)

  - [Only controls from the Texas Security Control Standards Catalog that are part of a LOW, MODERATE, or HIGH baseline](/required_controls)

Contributions and feedback for future control standards releases are welcome via GitHub. [Please open a new issue with your feedback](https://github.com/tamuscyber/tamus-control-standards/issues).

Machine-readable formats compliant with the Open Security Controls Assessment Language ([OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/)) are available in the [projectâ€™s GitHub repository](https://github.com/tamuscyber/tamus-control-standards) within `content`.
