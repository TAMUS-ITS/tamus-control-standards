Using the table above, any set of information can be assigned three security ratings: one for Confidentiality (LOW, MODERATE or HIGH), another for Integrity (LOW, MODERATE or HIGH), and a third for Availability (LOW, MODERATE or HIGH). This is useful for defining security controls in cases where, for example, a set of information may have a low need for confidentiality (LOW impact) but require HIGH availability. In this example, encryption may not be appropriate, but redundancy may be a requirement.

Most breaches that cause HIGH impact are a result of unauthorized access to Confidential information. Therefore, this document and System member assignment of categorization places prime importance on the level of Confidentiality required of the information.
